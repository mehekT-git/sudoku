# sudoku
A responsive Sudoku game in HTML, CSS and Javascript
This is a Sudoku game created in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  It is responsive and media queries are for that. In addition to that, it is tested across all the browsers and the behavior and UI is not affected on any platform or browser changes.
How it works?
On the launch of an application user is presented with three options: Easy, Medium and Hard.  Easy has 30 numbers on board, medium has 50 and hard option will have only 20 numbers on board. Once the difficulty is selected user will be presented with a Sudoku board. Below the board there will be numbers which one can select to fill the blank spaces on the board. Note that only the correct number can be placed on the specific spot.  Once the user fills all the blank spots on the board, means he has correctly solved the puzzle.
For look and feel simple transition effect is used at a number of places.  Also, Keyframe rule is used at 40% animation which specifies the animation code.
 
 Drawbacks: 
•	There is no option for a person to go back or anywhere else once he has started the application.
•	Once the user is done solving the puzzle he/she is not notified with the message.

If I had more time: 
•	Would have solved above two drawbacks.
•	If placing wrong number give user feedback it is wrong.
•	Create a reset button.
•	Create a new game button
•	Allow for game to be saved and retrieved (possible localstorage)
